I'm excited to introduce "Threads" â™Œ , a cutting-edge social media web application crafted with Next.js 14. Harnessing the power of server-side rendering, Threads ensures seamless performance.



ðŸ“Œ With robust authentication powered by Clerk SDK, users can trust their data is secure. Plus, "UploadThing" SDK facilitates hassle-free image uploads, while real-time event notifications are made possible through "Svix" webhook integration. "Zod" adds an extra layer of reliability with its schema validation feature.



ðŸ“Œ Dive into Thread's rich functionalityâ€”create threads, build communities, and engage with replies. Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we continue to enhance the platform!

Thread is proudly deployed on Vercel.
